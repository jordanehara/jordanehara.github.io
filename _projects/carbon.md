<!-- Description -->
Carbon is a story-driven puzzle game where you escape servitude to a spaceship's sentient autopilot. The player traverses each level trying to reach the end of the level by pushing buttons to open or close trapdoors, going through teleportation portals, and throwing themselves off ledges.

I lead a group of 3 as a solo developer and narrative designer to create this short story experience. Originally made for the Brackey's 2025.2 Game Jam, we decided to continue development after an influx of positive reviews and a strong desire to see the end of our beloved MC's story.
